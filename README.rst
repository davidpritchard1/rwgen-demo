RWGEN
=====

RWGEN is a stochastic spatiotemporal Rainfall and Weather GENerator based on
the Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulse (NSRP) rainfall model.

This repository contains a demonstration version of the rainfall model for two
example cases. For other applications, the full version of the model should be
used. This will soon be available online - please contact 
david.pritchard@newcastle.ac.uk for more information.
